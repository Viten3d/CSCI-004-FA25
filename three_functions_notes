>>What are functions?

Functions are portable series of instructions which return an unambiguous output.
Function Components:
  Name: The function needs to be bound to a name to be callable
  Type: The logic of the function will only be reliable if the correct input data type(s) are used
  Parameters: Arguments/inputs required for function to work properly
  Logic: The series of instructions within the function to be executed

Psuedocode Example:
  test_func0 = x + 2
    Name: func_1 | Type: numbers(integers) | Parameters: 'x', Range:â„¤ | Logic: 'x + 2', Increase the input value by 2 via addition
