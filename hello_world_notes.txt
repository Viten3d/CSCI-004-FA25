'array' is a module for python which contains multiple functions including array (array.array())
  Modules are collections of related functions organized under (bound to) a specific namespace. In this case the namespace and the function have the same name.
    Modules need to be imported (e.g. import array) to become available for use.
    Namespaces are where variables are stored.
