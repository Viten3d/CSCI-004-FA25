>>What is a calculator? (in this context)
A program that takes numerical values and performs some desired operation (logic) with those values, returning the result.
    A program is a set of functions (smaller sets of instructions) combined to complete a task.

>>How do I want the calculator to work?

Receive two numerical arguments (integers) to be evaluated and one to determine the method of evaluation. Return the end result.
    Use 'if' compound statements (if/elif/else) to ascertain the specific operation to be performed.
        'if': If some element(s) meet some criteria, then perform some set of instructions.
        'elif': If the prior 'if' did not have its criteria met, then run *this* 'if' statement instead.
        'else': If the prior 'if' or 'elif' did not have its criteria met, then perform some set of instructions.
        Compound Statements: (recall lines 64 and 65 of hello_world_notes.txt)

>Define the function and its arguments with the option for no arguments. (calc(n1,op,n2) may be more intuitive?)
    def calc(n1=None, n2=None, op=None):

>Return the operator codes when no arguments are given.
    if n1 == None and n2 == None and op == None:
        return f"Add: 0\nSub: 1\nMul: 2\nDiv: 3"

>Evaluate arguments only if all arguments are received and they are integers.
    if type(n1) == int and type(n2) == int and type(op) == int:
        # perform desired operation statement
    else:
        # return <error>
    
    OR, for just checking that all arguments are given:
        if n1 != None and n2 != None and op != None:

>Addition statement
    if op == 0:
        return x + y

>Subtraction statement; using 'elif' to avoid checking subsequent statements if 0 < op < 6.
    elif op == 1:
        return x - y

>Multiplication statement
    elif op == 2:
        return x * y

>Division statement
    elif op == 3:
        return x / y

>Power statement
    elif op == 4:
        return x ** y

>Concatenation statement; convert integers to strings so values are concatenated instead of added; convert result back to integer for use in other calculations.
    elif op == 5:
        x = str(x)
        y = str(y)
        temp = x + y
        return int(temp)

>Incorrect operator code statement
    else:
        return <error>
