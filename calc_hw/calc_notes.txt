>>What is a calculator?
A program that takes numerical values and performs some desired operation (logic) with those values, returning the result.
    A program is a set of functions (smaller sets of instructions) combined to complete a task.

>>How do I want the calculator to work?
Receive two numerical arguments (integers) to be evaluated and one to determine the method of evaluation. Return the end result.
    Use 'if' compound statements (if/elif/else) to ascertain the specific operation to be performed.
        'if': If some element(s) meet some criteria, then perform some set of instructions.
        'elif': If the prior 'if' or 'elif' did not have its criteria met, then run this 'if' statement instead.
        'else': If the prior 'if' or 'elif' did not have its criteria met, then perform some set of instructions.
        Compound Statements: (recall lines 64 and 65 of hello_world_notes.txt)

>Square root statement
    Use optimized version of the square root approximation function from three_functions2.py.
        While loop switched to for loop.

>Concatenation statement
Convert integers to strings so the values are concatenated instead of added.
Convert the result back to an integer for use in other calculations.
