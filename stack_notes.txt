>>What is a stack?

A stack is an ordered arrangement of some elements wherein the most recently added element in the stucture is to be removed first.
The head (last/youngest element added) and the tail (first/oldest element added) are to be accounted for.

>>How do you create a stack-like stucture in Python?

Initiate a framework for the stack to exist in using a list.
    stack = []

Create a function to add elements to the head posistion of the stack using the "insert" mutable sequence operation.
    def add(stack, head):
        stack.insert(0, head)  # first arg is index, index = 0 -> head
        return stack

Create a function to remove the elements from the head posistion of the stack using the "pop" mutable sequence operation.
    def remove(stack):
        stack.pop(0)
        return stack

Create a function to retrieve the head value.
    def head(stack):
        return stack[0]

Create a function to retrieve the tail value.
    def tail():
        return stack[-1]
