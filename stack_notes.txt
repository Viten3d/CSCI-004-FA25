>>What is a stack?

A stack is an arrangement of some elements, mutable by adding or removing elements and ordered by "in-stack" age, wherein a 'head' and a 'tail' component exist. The 'tail' is the oldest element in the stack. The 'head' is the youngest. Elements are to be removed from the 'head' position only.

>>How do you create a stack-like stucture in Python?

Initiate a framework for the stack to exist in using a list.
    stack = []

Create a function to add elements to the head posistion of the stack using the 'insert' mutable sequence operation.
    def add(stack, head):
        stack.insert(0, head)  # first arg is index, index = 0 -> head
        return stack

Create a function to remove the elements from the head posistion of the stack using 'pop'.
    def remove(stack):
        stack.pop(0)
        return stack

Create a function to retrieve the head value.
    def head(stack):
        return stack[0]

Create a function to retrieve the tail index + value.
    def tail(stack):
        return stack[len(stack) - 1] # stack length - 1 = last index (tail index)
